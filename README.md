# React Todo App

Basic todo app written in React.

## Aim

Gain a basic understanding of a React app. This includes components, props and how state is passed between functional components via hooks. Also how APi calls work with the app.

I also want to understand how to test a React app. I aim to cover unit, snapshot, integration and end-to-end testing.

## Tech

- React (using create-react-app)
- Jest
- Enzyme
- JSON placeholder (to pull in fake Todos)
- UUID

Note: Add diagram of app structure & screenshot

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
